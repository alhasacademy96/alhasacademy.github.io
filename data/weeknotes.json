    "content": "<p><strong>State of the DOI Pipeline</strong></p>\n<p>This week I compiled the current status of our DOI pipeline, examining both fetching and TEI-conversion stages.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Overall Database Numbers:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>PDF: 2.8 M raw → ~2.6 M TEI (91.96 %)</li>\n  <li>XML: 5.7 M raw → ~84 K TEI (1.46 %)</li>\n  <li>JSON: 1.4 M raw (∼2 M fetch logs)</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>DOI-to-Database:</strong> The \"big four\" publishers (Elsevier, Wiley, Taylor & Francis, Springer) account for ~90 % of fetches. About half fail—mostly 4xx errors (~700 K), access denials (~350 K), payload mismatches (HTML/JS wrappers), and unhandled redirects (~120 K).</p>\n<p><strong>Actionable Fixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Verify and refresh API access with the Library/publishers.</li>\n  <li>Improve <code>curl</code> to target PDF files, follow redirects, and enrich logs.</li>\n  <li>Build a live dashboard for real-time fetch monitoring.</li>\n  <li>Ensure compliance with publishers' robots.txt and scraping policies.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p><strong>DOI-to-TEI:</strong> PDF→TEI conversion is near-perfect, but XML→TEI lags (~84 K converted), especially for Elsevier's layered wrappers. PR #18 helps unwrap one layer, but we need comprehensive XSL tweaks.</p>\n<p><strong>Actionable Fixes:</strong></p>\n<ul>\n  <li>Enhance <code>Elsevier.xsl</code> to handle multi-layer wrappers; validate all publisher stylesheets.</li>\n  <li>Purge malformed/truncated XML from the DB and future fetches.</li>\n  <li>Separate HTML from XML before conversion to avoid mix-ups.</li>\n  <li>Merge/rebase PR #18 and test across JATS and SVAPI feeds.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>By confirming access and refining our conversion logic, we aim to hit ≥ 90 % fetch success and near-complete XML-to-TEI conversion—fulfilling the pipeline's core objective.</p>",
